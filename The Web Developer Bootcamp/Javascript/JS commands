alert = displays a message to the user
console.log = displays to the console
prompt = used kind of link an alert but has a box to type in

for loop goes as follows
    for(init; condition; step){}

setInterval(function, interval(in ms))
                ^^ you can make its own function right there to run inside the setInterval. //its called an anonymous function
clearInterval() //put number in () to stop
